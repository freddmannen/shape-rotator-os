// ATLAS — the fifth tab.
//
// Product intent (the user, paraphrased):
//   "A graph of all my searches and my friends' searches. Constantly on
//    during a multi-week event, projected from a laptop onto a wall.
//    Calm, explorable. Form an opinion."
//
// What this is:
//   A wall map of the corpus. Each peer is a country with a soft
//   watercolor wash and a fixed centroid. Each page the network has
//   fetched is a town placed deterministically inside its country.
//   Cross-peer co-contributions are caravan routes arching between
//   countries. The composition is photographable, the layout is stable
//   across reloads, and the only motion budget is: a 30-second inhale,
//   a 6-second wet-edge ripple on arrivals, and one slow ink-mark
//   surveyor drifting over the continent.
//
// Why a separate tab (and not a new lens on graph/cartography/cosmos):
//   - graph is the 3D analyst's instrument.
//   - cartography is the streamline-flow editorial cut.
//   - cosmos is the gpu-force "let it cool" cut.
//   Atlas is the *artifact* — the thing those instruments are *of*.
//   It's the one the user wants on the wall. The aesthetic inverts
//   the dark cosmic palette of every other tab to a paper-cream
//   ground, which is what photographs.
//
// Stack:
//   Vanilla Canvas2D. No three, no d3-delaunay, no force sim. The
//   borders are a *distance-field wash* drawn at half-resolution to
//   an offscreen canvas: per-pixel nearest-centroid weighted by
//   territory size, with an exponential falloff. That gives organic
//   wet-paper edges without polygon gymnastics. Borders are derived
//   from the wash by a one-pass marching-square-ish edge detect at
//   render time and traced with a single stroke per country.
//
// Determinism / stability:
//   Country centroids placed by a Fibonacci-spiral hash of the
//   pubkey (self at the origin). Town positions placed by a per-page
//   hash within their country. Same dataset → pixel-identical render.
//   New page → previous render + one new dot, nothing moves.
//
// Public API (mirrors graph2 / cosmos):
//   mount(container)          — idempotent
//   setActive(active)         — visibility-hidden friendly; pauses rAF
//   notifyDataChanged()       — debounced rebuild
//   pulseNode(nodeId)         — wet-edge ripple on the page's country
//   unmount()                 — destroy canvas + listeners
//
// Reads from window.srwk.{nodes, edges, peers, selfPubkey}.

// → truncated SVD (k=30) → k-means (K=15) → 2D MDS of cluster centroids.
// Each cluster becomes one ATLAS country; the 2D MDS gives the map
// position; TF-IDF-style c-TF-IDF naming (already in this file) provides
// the territory name. Page identity is preserved so peer/host still show

//
// Constraints:
//   - pure JS, no dependencies, no model download
//   - cold compute under 2s, cached under 300ms
//   - deterministic given the same set of page-IDs (mulberry32 seeded
//     by hash of sorted IDs). Adding a page may shift the layout
//     slightly — that's fine for v1; multi-week stability comes later.
//
