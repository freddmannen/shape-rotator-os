# Week 2 Project Intros (Crossroads, Wikigen) and a Product-Market Fit Deep Dive

**Interrogate the market before you polish the tech.**

*A cohort team presented a key-encumbrance-based cross-chain exchange and fielded sharp market-viability questions, followed by a guest session on what product-market fit actually means for deep-tech founders.*

## the 60-second version

A cohort team presented a key-encumbrance cross-chain exchange that moves trust from bridge validators into cryptographic signing policy, then fielded sharp questions about whether the cross-chain-swap market is even worth attacking right now. A guest PMF lecture supplied the frame: fit means proven retention and willingness to pay for a specific segment, and AI-era defensibility shifts to distribution, proprietary data, and reliability.

## themes

- trust-minimized cross-chain infrastructure
- product-market fit fundamentals
- founder-market fit and niche-first go-to-market
- AI-era moats and reliability

## insights

- Crossroads is building a cross-chain exchange that replaces bridge validator sets and custodians with key encumbrance: policy is embedded directly in the signing authority, so a payout transaction is signed only when verified chain state, account epoch, and signing conditions are satisfied — shifting the control point from an external approval network into cryptographic policy and mitigating replay and double-spend risks.
- The claimed advantages of the design are threefold: permissionless onboarding of new assets and chains (anyone can define an asset contract and liquidity pool without coordinating with the core team), wrapped assets that exist as standard ERC-20s and compose directly with existing DeFi, and a cost structure that trends toward centralized-exchange pricing because there are no validator or custodian fees, only liquidity spread and execution overhead.
- The user model is one persistent universal balance instead of discrete bridge-plus-swap steps: deposit a native asset to an encumbered account, prove deposit inclusion with a Merkle transaction proof to mint a wrapped balance, swap freely within that balance, and withdraw via a signing committee that checks protocol policy before authorizing the destination-chain payout. Remaining work includes replacing the mock signing committee with real MPC and extending beyond EVM chains.
- Go-to-market angles under consideration: crypto-native users on routes where existing bridges are slow, expensive, or absent; agents doing repeated cross-chain actions that want a persistent balance exposed via API rather than bridging each time; and institutions or real-world-asset players who want custody rules encoded directly into execution policy instead of trusting a custodian.
- Q&A surfaced what business buyers actually weigh for cross-chain infrastructure: decentralization and compliance posture (centralized components become liability when regulators or financial institutions ask questions) and latency (slow cross-chain state sync creates exploitable information asymmetry). Past bridge exploits where a multisig effectively rubber-stamped a single proposer were cited as exactly the failure class that policy-constrained signing addresses.
- Mentor market context for the team and the room: pure cross-chain swap and intent-solver businesses carry razor-thin spreads and low volume in the current market, and experienced operators in the space have pivoted toward capital-efficiency and credit services or run their own proprietary solvers to retain margin. The advice was to interrogate the market before polishing the tech, dogfood with friendly power users to measure real impact, and explore agentic payments, negotiation, and coordination as less crowded adjacencies where research rigor matters more.
- The guest lecture's core PMF themes (general principles, unattributed pending speaker consent): product-market fit means a proven value hypothesis for a specific segment — sustained retention and willingness to pay, not raw signups, viral spikes, or satisfaction scores; classic failure modes are building in the dark without user contact, spreading across too many personas, scaling before fit is proven, and oversharing roadmaps prematurely; the winning pattern is a narrow, winnable niche with adjacent niches to expand into, with viable unit economics that account for cost of sale, and moats tested over time via network effects, distribution advantages, and sector complexity.
- AI-era PMF themes that resonated with the cohort: horizontal AI layers face cannibalization by large foundation-model labs, so defensibility shifts to distribution, proprietary data and access, and closing the gap between an 80% demo and a 99%-reliable workflow — including outcome-based pricing for fully owned workflows and automating the human weak links that bottleneck technology diffusion. A recurring cohort-wide observation was that founder-market fit precedes product-market fit: technically strong teams' common gap is market sense, and B2B readiness requires reliability, SLAs, controls, and permissions — with the cohort itself being the best first user base to win over on product strength.

## q&a

**Q: Is there a deployed, running version of Crossroads?**

Not yet — the demo currently runs locally. The team has not chosen which chain to deploy onto, and latency benchmarking is deferred until that decision is made.

**Q: Can a company self-host the verification infrastructure for compliance reasons?**

Self-hosting intent verification is not supported, but the modular design means anyone can permissionlessly onboard a new asset or chain by defining its asset contract and liquidity pool, after which others can swap that asset.

**Q: How does this differ from existing bridges and cross-chain messaging layers?**

Most existing systems route trust through a validator network or external intent verification; this design ties execution to policy-constrained signing on encumbered accounts, so release of assets depends on cryptographic policy and verified state rather than an external approval network.

**Q: What do enterprise-leaning buyers care about most in cross-chain infrastructure?**

Two things: decentralization and compliance posture, since centralized components create liability when regulators ask questions, and latency, since slow cross-chain state updates create information asymmetry that can be exploited.

**Q: Is cross-chain swap infrastructure the right market to attack in 2026?**

Mentor feedback was skeptical of the pure-solver market: spreads are thin, volume is low, and seasoned teams have pivoted to capital-efficiency or credit services or run proprietary solvers for margin. The suggested reframe was to question the market before the tech and consider agentic payment and coordination use cases as a blue-ocean angle.
