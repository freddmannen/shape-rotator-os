## Membrane: light mode support (2026-06-13)

- The membrane page was dark-only; it now follows the app's `html[data-theme="light"]`
  toggle. **Dark mode is unchanged** — every change is gated on the theme, read once at
  scene mount (`getTheme()` in [scene.js](apps/os/src/renderer/membrane/scene.js); the
  toggle lives on the profile page so the scene always remounts with the right theme).
- **CSS** ([membrane.css](apps/os/src/renderer/membrane/membrane.css)): host background →
  paper, the cream ink triple tokenized as `--mem-ink-rgb` (dark mode resolves to the
  identical value) and flipped to near-black in the light block, panels → light glass,
  reading-gutter scrim + throne glow + "enter field" pill lightened.
- **WebGL** ([starfield.js](apps/os/src/renderer/membrane/starfield.js),
  [cube.js](apps/os/src/renderer/membrane/cube.js)): additive blending is invisible on
  white, so light mode switches stars + cube edge-lines to **normal blending**. Stars use
  a faint pale palette (barely-there on white per request) and the additive nebula mist is
  dropped. The cube stays vivid (body shader untouched) but its rim/edges are driven from
  the darker domain `baseColor` so the wireframe reads on white. Bloom is tuned down in
  light mode (threshold 0.80 / strength 0.40) so the body doesn't wash the page.
- **Light-mode polish**: the membrane field is now a touch DARKER than the feed/
  agenda cards (radial `#efefef→#e2e2e2`, won via a higher-specificity selector over
  the generic `.alchemy-canvas` bg rule) so cards read as white cards. Feed kind
  tints + agenda category colors are darkened to readable hues in light mode (the
  pale sage/lapis/amber/teal pastels washed out on white); cards go near-white.
- **Hover glow now blooms**: hovering a face drives a bright emissive from a new
  `uGlowColor` uniform (the bright rim pastel, both themes) at HDR gain 1.6, so the
  hovered facet crosses the UnrealBloom threshold and the pass throws a real colored
  halo instead of just a brightness bump. (Dark-mode hover also blooms harder now.)
- Transcript feed chips remain hidden (separate parked item). The full calendar TAB
  (calendar.css) still lacks light-mode category colors — separate follow-up.

## Membrane: agenda rolls forward to upcoming days (2026-06-13)

- The right-edge agenda no longer reads blank on a quiet today. It keeps the
  today time-axis + glowing now-line **only when today has timed events**;
  when today is empty it skips the tall empty axis and leads with a
  look-ahead list (the "empty day" problem — Apple "Up Next" / roll-forward
  model, per research on Google/Fantastical/widget patterns).
- **Unified with the left feed.** Every agenda item — today's all-day items
  AND upcoming events — is a card with the same chrome as the left feed item
  (1px border, 9px corners, ~53px tall, 2-line: title over a sub like the
  time or "all day"). No "TODAY" header. Grouped under weekday-name + date
  headers (e.g. "SUN JUN 14"). The today time-axis + now-line is still used
  when today actually has timed events.
- **Clickable** — each agenda card is a button that opens the calendar in a
  new OS tab (`window.__srwkOpenInNewTab`), like clicking through from the
  calendar view. The agenda sits at z-index 2 (above the canvas) with the
  container passing pointer events through and the cards opting back in.
- Card titles WRAP (no truncation) — a long event name flows onto a second
  line and the card grows, rather than clipping to "…".
- **Category color + contrast** — cards carry the calendar's category tint
  (`data-cat` → `--c2-acc`, same hexes as calendar.css) at ~20% fill / 38%
  border, giving more contrast against the dark stage than the flat neutral.
  Day headers are ~30% brighter (0.34 → 0.44 alpha) for legibility. Built by a new `eventsUpcoming` in
  `computeMembraneData()` ([alchemy.js](apps/os/src/renderer/alchemy.js)) from
  the same two sources as `eventsToday` — calendar GRID cells (new
  `upcomingGridEvents()` over the next ~4 weeks) + cohort event spans —
  deduped by title across the window (recurring spans surface once), skipping
  today's items, day-ordered, capped at 10. Day labels are recomputed from
  each item's date at render time so they don't go stale overnight.
  [membrane/index.js](apps/os/src/renderer/membrane/index.js) renders the
  block below the track; the agenda is now a flex column so the track yields
  room. Width unchanged (190px). Today behavior/constants/now-line untouched.

## Membrane: clickable "what's new" feed on the left edge (2026-06-13)

- **Left-edge activity feed** mirroring the right-edge agenda. A recency-
  sorted, color-coded stream of cohort activity as small two-line cards
  (color rail + label + meta + relative age), scrollable, no header text:
  - **release** (green) — per-project GitHub activity, expanded from each
    weekly summary into its individual example commit subjects (incl.
    shape-rotator-os)
  - **transcript** (lapis) — newly-distilled session readouts
  - **ask** (amber) / **event** (jade) when present
- Each item leads with a per-kind Lucide icon (same set as the rail/tabs) so
  the type reads at a glance — github / file-text / message-circle / calendar
  for release / transcript / ask / event. Icon AND the project/kind chip share
  one per-kind tint (sage / lapis / amber / teal) at a softened saturation —
  clearly colored but dialed back from the original loud green. Transcripts
  are dated by their git-added (upload) date, not the older session date, so
  newly-distilled readouts surface as fresh.
- **Clickable** — each card opens that thing in a NEW OS tab via
  `window.__srwkOpenInNewTab()` (new hook in [tabs.js](apps/os/src/renderer/tabs.js)):
  a release opens its project (cohort detail), a transcript opens the
  context/transcripts view, an ask opens asks, an event opens the calendar.
  The feed sits above the canvas (z-index 2) on the left edge so it's
  interactive without blocking the centered cube.
- **Build-time generation**: the feed is generated by `buildWhatsNew()` in
  [build-bundles.js](scripts/build-bundles.js) and bundled into the surface
  as `whats_new` (expands github example commits, transcripts, asks, recent
  events; date-sanity filtered; cap 60). [cohort-source.js](apps/os/src/renderer/cohort-source.js)
  sources it preferring main's copy but falling back to the bundled fixture,
  so the feed reads full even before the rebuilt surface ships to main.
  [alchemy.js](apps/os/src/renderer/alchemy.js) prefers `c.whats_new`, with a
  live `buildWhatsNewFeed()` fallback. Also: build-bundles no longer gates
  GitHub artifacts on `review_status: reviewed` (deduped per project/week,
  reviewed copy preferred). Requires `npm run build:cohort`.

## Membrane: psychedelic cube replaces the blob cluster (2026-06-12)

- **The 4-orb blob cluster in the lower-right is gone.** In its place: one
  slowly tumbling cube dead-center of the stage
  ([cube.js](apps/os/src/renderer/membrane/cube.js)) —
  liquid iridescent surface (trig domain-warp through an IQ cosine palette,
  texture-free), additive glowing edges, and a counter-rotating inner wire
  cube. The fresnel rim + edges feed the existing bloom pass.
- **Interaction model preserved**: footer dots switch the active domain
  (self/cohort/events/asks) — the cube TINTS toward that domain's colors
  instead of orbs swapping slots. Clicking the cube opens the active panel;
  clicking the void folds it away. Orbital name ring still rides the anchor.
- **Grab it**: drag anywhere on the canvas to spin the cube (screen-space
  arcball, premultiplied quaternion), release mid-swipe for fling momentum
  that eases back into the idle tumble (~2.5s). Cursor: grab/grabbing.
- **Speed → brightness**: the scene measures the cube's actual per-frame
  rotation (quaternion `angleTo`), maps speed-above-idle into a 0..1 energy
  uniform, and the shader lifts the whole surface (and edge glow) above the
  bloom threshold — so the faster you spin/fling it the more it blazes, and
  it sits at default brightness at rest. Energy ramps up fast (0.25/frame)
  and coasts down slow (0.06/frame) so the glow trails the motion.
- **Spin-to-morph the die**: it boots as the **d20** and changes shape when
  you spin it fast — it must stay above the trigger speed for ~0.5s
  (sustained, not a single fast frame), then a hysteresis latch fires one
  morph per fast burst (spin must slow back down to re-arm), so you can land
  on a specific shape.
- **Click to stop**: clicking the cube halts it instantly (zeroes the spin)
  and it stays still; clicking an already-stopped cube does nothing.
  Dragging it revives the motion (and the idle tumble afterward). Void-click
  toggles the panel. Per-frame dt is clamped so a backgrounded tab can't
  blow up the spin physics.
- **Shape roster** (`ALLOWED_FACES`, cycled in order with wraparound): cube
  (d6, 6), pentagonal prism (7), octahedron (d8, 8), dodecahedron (d12, 12),
  icosahedron (d20, 20). The Platonic dice render as the REAL solid; the
  pentagonal prism is built from an exact polygon ring, all normalized to a
  constant bounding radius.
- **Today's agenda backdrop**: an ambient day-timeline pinned to the right
  edge, sitting BEHIND the canvas (z-index 0, so the cube + stars render over
  it). Shows ONLY today's events (`eventsToday`) — all-day items as a header,
  timed events placed on a vertical time axis with hour ticks — and a glowing
  warm line marks the current time, re-rendered each minute. (The shape-name
  label is hidden — `display:none`; no longer surfaced.)
- **Shape name label**: the current shape's name + face count is shown on
  the right edge of the stage (e.g. "icosahedron · d20 · 20 faces") so
  shapes can be referenced by name.
- **Organic morph between shapes**: the transition is a smooth ~0.52s
  reshape, not an instant swap. A fixed-topology icosphere (detail 4)
  radially projects onto each target solid's face-planes, so every vertex's
  radius can be tweened (easeInOutCubic) with a subtle sine wobble (~5%)
  that swells in then out mid-morph. The crisp glowing edge-lines fade out
  for the morph and fade back in once it settles. At REST the body swaps to
  the true solid (flat per-face normals → crisp facets); the icosphere is
  only shown during the transition.
- **Optimized**: 24 blob draw calls → 3; dropped the PMREM environment,
  all lights, per-blob geometry sculpting and the pressure shader
  (blob.js/geometry.js/noise.js/pressureMaterial.js deleted).

## Update indicator polish (2026-06-12)

- **Downloading = number only**: the progress ring is gone; the slot shows
  just the live "NN%" while an update downloads.
- **"Open installer" ready state** uses the Lucide package-open glyph
  (picked over folder-open / external-link / play) instead of a checkmark,
  which was confusable with the transient "up to date" check.

## Loud update-available signal (2026-06-12)

- **Update banner**: when a newer release is detected (silent boot check
  or main's periodic check, now every 2h instead of 6h) a persistent
  "update available!" banner appears in the left side panel, directly
  above the profile/version footer row and matching the panel width. Its
  background "breathes" (slow brightness pulse, reduced-motion aware) to
  draw the eye. Clicking it runs the platform's existing download/install
  action — that is the only way to clear it (no dismiss). Previously the
  only signal was the small icon by the version chip (bottom-left), which
  users missed.
- **Background checks now reach the UI**: main's `update-available` event
  was stderr-only; it's now forwarded over new IPC `fg:update-available`
  ([main.js](apps/os/main.js) → [preload.js](apps/os/preload.js) →
  `announceUpdateAvailable()` in [boot.js](apps/os/src/renderer/boot.js)),
  so week-long sessions learn about releases without anyone clicking.
- **Old-version broadcast**:
  [cohort-data/asks/2026-06-12-update-your-app.md](cohort-data/asks/2026-06-12-update-your-app.md)
  — every install ≥v0.2.10 polling cohort-data renders it on the asks
  wall, nudging users on old builds (which predate the banner) to update.

## Arrow-key view-tab navigation + white-blink fix (2026-06-11)

- **←/→ cycle the current page's view tabs** (program handbook pages,
  cohort views, calendar/presence, context views) with wrap-around.
  One document-level handler in [alchemy.js](apps/os/src/renderer/alchemy.js)
  clicks the neighbouring `.alch-page-views` / `.alch-prog-tabs` button, so
  each page's existing wiring does the work. Skips typing contexts and
  modifier'd arrows (alt+←/→ stays history nav).
- **Page-switch white blink fixed**: the body wash gradients set only a
  background-IMAGE, leaving `background-color` transparent — when a heavy
  page switch missed a raster deadline the compositor flashed the default
  white base. Solid fallback colors added under every body-wash gradient
  plus a `body::before` fixed backdrop on its own compositor layer
  (never invalidates, so dropped frames composite over the dark wash).
  Verified via CDP screencast: 3 white frames / 240 switches before,
  0 / 480 after.

## Calendar page redesign — one-view timeline (2026-06-11)

Replaced the day/week/presence sub-tabbed calendar with a single
Google-Calendar-shaped week view ([apps/os/src/renderer/calendar.js](apps/os/src/renderer/calendar.js) + `.css`):

- **Layout**: days as columns left→right (mon–sun), vertical hour axis,
  events as time-positioned blocks; overlapping events split side-by-side.
- **Never looks sparse**: the hour window hugs the week's actual content,
  runs of 2+ event-free hours collapse into thin hatched "open" bands
  (non-linear time axis), active hours stretch to fill the viewport, and
  unscheduled regions of each day are tiled with quiet "open" blocks.
- **Cards adapt to rendered size** (container queries): sliver = one line,
  tall = full title + detail bullets inline, no click needed; click opens
  a detail modal.
- **Robust time parsing** for the sheet's formats: `19:00 x`,
  `12:00-14:00 x`, `- 1600-1730 x`, `1600 - 1830: x`, `09:00am: x`;
  bare-time first lines promote the next line to the title.
- **Multi-day text events** (`Mon-Tue: …` in the first day's cell) mirror
  onto every covered day; day-name prefixes stripped from titles.
- **All-day lane** for untimed items, category-tinted chips.
- **Presence** (availability gantt) is a second tab on the page, using the
  shared `.alch-page-views` nav; gantt vertical scrolling fixed.
- **Navigation**: one centered strip `← 1 2 … 10 →`; today's week dot has
  a white outline, the viewed week fills oxide. Today is highlighted by
  white contrast only (no badge, no red).
- **Unified chrome**: shared view-nav tabs, standard canvas gutters across
  all pages (asks/cohort de-centered, cohort's narrowed padding removed),
  presence-head buttons share one pill style.
- Legacy renderer (`cohort-calendar-week.js` renderWeekView) remains in
  `packages/shape-ui` for the sibling web app; the Electron page no longer
  uses it. Saved `calendar2` modes/tabs migrate to `calendar`.
