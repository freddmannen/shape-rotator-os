# Shape Rotator OS — PR Triage Log

Hourly autonomous PR triage. Merges small safe diffs, holds large/protocol/security/external-author PRs for human review, closes clearly-off-base or stale PRs. Each entry is appended.

## 2026-05-19 06:30 EDT

**Open PRs**: 5 across both repos (sros: 2, swf-node: 3)

**This tick**: no action — queue full, holding (threshold is >3)

**Queue snapshot**:
- sros #76 (nikolaixyz, +14/-5, 2026-05-18T18:43Z): "profile: update kristel-alliksaar". Held by rule: external author + not a trivial typo fix. This is the expected cohort-data PR-your-profile flow; needs human review for content correctness before auto-merge logic should ever touch it.
- sros #93 (dmarzzz, +480/-1, 2026-05-19T09:10Z): "feat(hermes): PoC — local LLM cohort assistant via Ollama". Held by rule: diff >300 LOC. PoC-tagged feature; human review.
- swf-node #11 (dependabot): softprops/action-gh-release 2→3. Eligible to merge once queue drops.
- swf-node #10 (dependabot): actions/upload-artifact 4→7. Eligible to merge once queue drops.
- swf-node #9 (dependabot): actions/checkout 4→6. Eligible to merge once queue drops.

**Releases cut**: none

**Next tick should**: when queue drops below 4 total, process oldest first: drain dependabot PRs (verify CI green, then squash-merge), comment on #76 (ask author for any clarifying context but treat as cohort-flow contribution), let #93 sit for human review.

## 2026-05-19 06:49 EDT

**Open PRs**: 5 across both repos (sros: 2, swf-node: 3) — unchanged since previous tick

**This tick**: no action — queue full, holding (threshold is >3)

**Queue snapshot**: identical to 06:30 entry above. No human triage activity in the intervening 19 minutes.

**Releases cut**: none

**Next tick should**: same as previous. If queue is still full at the next tick, surface this to the user explicitly in chat — the loop's job is blocked until human review unsticks #76 and #93.

## 2026-05-19 07:49 EDT

**Open PRs**: 5 across both repos (sros: 2, swf-node: 3) — unchanged for the third consecutive tick

**This tick**: no action — queue full, holding (threshold is >3)

**Queue snapshot**: identical to prior two entries.

**Releases cut**: none

**Loop status**: blocked. Three consecutive holds. The loop will continue logging holds until either (a) #76 + #93 are merged/closed by a human, or (b) the cron is canceled. The dependabot trio (#9/#10/#11) can't be auto-merged in isolation because the queue-size guardrail counts them too. Consider triaging #76 and #93 manually so the next tick can drain the dependabot stack.

## 2026-05-19 08:49 EDT

**Open PRs**: 5 across both repos (sros: 2, swf-node: 3) — unchanged for the fourth consecutive tick

**This tick**: no action — queue full, holding (threshold is >3)

**Loop status**: still blocked. Four consecutive PR-triage holds. No human triage on #76 or #93. The dependabot trio remains stuck behind the queue-size guardrail and is now 1d+ old; if it keeps aging past 7 days the close-stale-PR rule will engage automatically (today is 2026-05-19, dependabot PRs created 2026-05-18 — six days to go).

**Releases cut**: none

**Next tick should**: keep holding until human triage. If we hit 7 consecutive ticks (≈3.5h from now) without movement, write a CRITICAL entry recommending the user disable the cron or raise the threshold.

## 2026-05-19 09:49 EDT

5 PRs, held (tick 5). No change. See 08:25 maturity-tick CRITICAL entry for action items.

## 2026-05-19 10:49 EDT

5 PRs, held (tick 6). No change.

## 2026-05-19 11:49 EDT

5 PRs, held (tick 7). No change.

## 2026-05-19 12:49 EDT

5 PRs, held (tick 8). No change.

## 2026-05-19 13:49 EDT

5 PRs, held (tick 9). No change.

## 2026-05-19 14:49 EDT

5 PRs, held (tick 10). No change.

## 2026-05-19 15:49 EDT

**Open PRs**: 2 across both repos (sros: 2, swf-node: 0)

**This tick**: queue dropped to 2 (under threshold of >3) — first chance to evaluate individual PRs in a while:
- sros #93 (dmarzzz, +480/-1, Hermes Ollama PoC) — HELD. User explicitly flagged: "dont merge the hermes PR its broken". Also exceeds size guardrail (>300 LOC).
- sros #94 (dmarzzz, +3981/-400 across 98 files, "cohort membership taxonomy + broadsheet calendar overhaul") — HELD. Diff is 13× the size guardrail. Even though authored by dmarzzz, too large to auto-merge safely; needs human review.

**Releases cut**: none in this tick. Two big releases shipped earlier this hour outside the loop: swf-node v0.12.0 (/node/log endpoint + node-wide event ring) and SROS v0.1.32 (Network tab subscribed to /node/log).

**Next tick should**: if user closes/merges #93 + #94, queue is empty and the loop can resume normal cadence. Otherwise hold continues.

## 2026-05-19 16:49 EDT

**Open PRs**: 3 across both repos (sros: 3, swf-node: 0)

**Queue (oldest first)**:
- sros #93 (dmarzzz, +480 LOC, Hermes PoC) — still HELD per user "broken, don't merge"
- sros #94 (dmarzzz, +3981/-400, cohort membership taxonomy) — still HELD, 13× size guardrail
- sros #98 (dmarzzz, NEW) — "fix(boot): skip splash on warm boot; show small 'syncing cohort' chip instead". Looks like exactly the UX fix the optimization target asks for. Not triaged this tick because rules say oldest-first and the slot is consumed by #93 + #94.

**This tick**: no merges. Per max-2-oldest-first rule, both slots went to held PRs that haven't changed since prior ticks. #98 deferred to next tick (or to user fast-merge).

**Releases cut**: none this tick. Earlier in the hour: swf-node v0.12.1, SROS v0.1.33 — both visual/health-event fixes.

**Next tick should**: if user merges #98 themselves or closes #93/#94 to free a slot, the loop can pick up #98. The change is small, isolated to boot path, and serves a confirmed user pain point (the splash blocking).

## 2026-05-19 17:49 EDT

**Open PRs**: 5 across both repos (sros: 5 — #93, #94, #98, #99, #100; swf-node: 0)

**This tick**: queue back over the >3 threshold — holding all. Two new PRs landed this hour: #99 (calendar keyboard shortcut hint bar) and #100 (calendar now-line at current time). Both look like small targeted UX wins, both from dmarzzz, both probably mergeable once the queue drains.

**Releases cut**: none

**Next tick should**: prioritize calendar PRs #99 + #100 once #93/#94 clear — they're the kind of small, isolated UX polish that moves the day-1 cohort score upward. #98 (warm boot) also still waiting.

## 2026-05-19 18:49 EDT

6 PRs (sros: 6 — #93/#94/#98/#99/#100/#101 calendar relative day labels), held. Stack keeps growing while the two oldest stay blocked.

## 2026-05-19 19:49 EDT

**Open PRs**: 1 across both repos (sros: 1 — #103; swf-node: 0). Queue cleared dramatically — user merged the stack manually earlier this hour.

**This tick**:
- sros #103 (dmarzzz, +27/-5 across 5 files, "dim past days so today and upcoming days pull focus") — MERGED. Targeted `review/calendar-ux-stack` integration branch, not main directly, so main HEAD didn't move; the user is stacking calendar UX polish onto an integration branch they'll PR to main later.

**Releases cut**: none this tick. SROS v0.1.35 shipped earlier (calendar fix).

**Next tick should**: watch for the `review/calendar-ux-stack` → main PR — when it lands it'll roll up #103 (and any other UX polish accumulated). Otherwise queue is drained.

## 2026-05-19 20:50 EDT

**Open PRs**: 1 across both repos (sros: 1 — #104; swf-node: 0)

**This tick**:
- sros #104 (dmarzzz, +40/-0 across 2 files, "oxide focus rings on keyboard-navigable controls") — MERGED. Targeted `review/calendar-ux-stack` integration branch, calendar a11y polish.

**Releases cut**: none. Calendar polish stacks on the integration branch; main not affected. swf-node v0.12.2 shipped earlier this hour (kind_pulled fix).

**Next tick should**: still waiting for the integration branch → main PR.

## 2026-05-19 21:49 EDT

**Open PRs**: 1 across both repos (sros: 1 — #105; swf-node: 0)

**This tick**:
- sros #105 (dmarzzz, +58/-16 across 4 files, "complete prefers-reduced-motion coverage across all transitions") — MERGED into `review/calendar-ux-stack`. a11y polish.

**Releases cut**: none this tick.

**Next tick should**: the calendar-ux-stack is accumulating polish (#103/#104/#105). Watch for the stack → main PR.

## 2026-05-19 22:49 EDT

**Open PRs**: 1 across both repos (sros: 1 — #106; swf-node: 0)

**This tick**:
- sros #106 (dmarzzz, +150/-0 across 7 files, "loading skeleton before first data fetch") — HELD per strict file-count rule (>5). Effectively 4 logical files inflated by the canonical+vendored mirror-pair pattern; comment posted recommending manual merge if user wants it on review/calendar-ux-stack.

**Releases cut**: none

**Next tick should**: if user manual-merges #106, the integration stack continues to grow. Eventually the stack → main PR will land.

## 2026-05-19 23:49 EDT

#106 still held (7 files > 5 cap). No new PRs.

## 2026-05-20 10:17 EDT

#106 still open + held. No change overnight.
