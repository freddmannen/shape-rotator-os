# Shape Rotator OS — Maturity Log

Hourly autonomous self-assessment + improvement loop. Each entry is appended; the audit trail is the file. Don't rewrite history.

## 2026-05-19 06:30 EDT

**Score**: 6/10 (early alpha — Phase 2 sync proven on LAN, heartbeat pulses + activity log live, LS cache yields instant boot on subsequent launches, but onboarding flow still rough and mac-x64 binary missing from latest swf-node releases)

**Picked**: nothing — queue full, holding for review

**Why**: 5 open PRs across both repos (threshold is >2 for the maturity tick). Per guardrail: "do nothing this tick except log 'queue full, holding'".

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Queue snapshot**:
- sros #76 (nikolaixyz): profile: update kristel-alliksaar (+14/-5) — external author, awaiting human review
- sros #93 (dmarzzz): feat(hermes) Ollama PoC (+480/-1) — large diff, awaiting human review
- swf-node #11, #10, #9 (dependabot): action version bumps

**Next tick should**: re-check the queue. If it's drained below 3 open PRs, identify the next improvement: most likely candidates are (a) onboarding flow for first-launch UX, (b) README install steps for cohort members, (c) investigate mac-x64 swf-node binary queue stuck on GH Actions, (d) spec drift between docs/SYNC.md §11 LAN-trust mode and current store.py behavior.

**Score**: 6/10 (unchanged from 06:30 — no work shipped, queue still blocking)

**Picked**: nothing — queue full, holding for review

**Why**: same as previous tick. Same 5 PRs open (sros #76, #93; swf-node #9, #10, #11). Threshold is >2 for the maturity tick.

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Next tick should**: if queue STILL hasn't moved by the next firing, escalate visibly to the user — three consecutive blocked ticks means the loop is wasting its window. Highest-leverage candidates ready to ship the moment the queue clears: (a) onboarding flow polish, (b) README cohort install steps, (c) mac-x64 GH-Actions investigation, (d) docs/SYNC.md §11 spec audit.
