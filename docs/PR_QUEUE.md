# Shape Rotator OS — PR Triage Log

Hourly autonomous PR triage. Merges small safe diffs, holds large/protocol/security/external-author PRs for human review, closes clearly-off-base or stale PRs. Each entry is appended.

## 2026-05-19 06:30 EDT

**Open PRs**: 5 across both repos (sros: 2, swf-node: 3)

**This tick**: no action — queue full, holding (threshold is >3)

**Queue snapshot**:
- sros #76 (nikolaixyz, +14/-5, 2026-05-18T18:43Z): "profile: update kristel-alliksaar". Held by rule: external author + not a trivial typo fix. This is the expected cohort-data PR-your-profile flow; needs human review for content correctness before auto-merge logic should ever touch it.
- sros #93 (dmarzzz, +480/-1, 2026-05-19T09:10Z): "feat(hermes): PoC — local LLM cohort assistant via Ollama". Held by rule: diff >300 LOC. PoC-tagged feature; human review.
- swf-node #11 (dependabot): softprops/action-gh-release 2→3. Eligible to merge once queue drops.
- swf-node #10 (dependabot): actions/upload-artifact 4→7. Eligible to merge once queue drops.
- swf-node #9 (dependabot): actions/checkout 4→6. Eligible to merge once queue drops.

**Releases cut**: none

**Next tick should**: when queue drops below 4 total, process oldest first: drain dependabot PRs (verify CI green, then squash-merge), comment on #76 (ask author for any clarifying context but treat as cohort-flow contribution), let #93 sit for human review.

## 2026-05-19 06:49 EDT

**Open PRs**: 5 across both repos (sros: 2, swf-node: 3) — unchanged since previous tick

**This tick**: no action — queue full, holding (threshold is >3)

**Queue snapshot**: identical to 06:30 entry above. No human triage activity in the intervening 19 minutes.

**Releases cut**: none

**Next tick should**: same as previous. If queue is still full at the next tick, surface this to the user explicitly in chat — the loop's job is blocked until human review unsticks #76 and #93.
