# Reviewed Transcript Import Map

This is the review map for the current Shape Rotator OS transcript audit. It separates existing OS coverage from candidate transcript files that match calendar events but should not be submitted raw until their content boundary is approved.

> **2026-06-10 content-boundary update.** Raw transcripts no longer live in this public repo. Per the content policy (raw transcripts are never published beyond attendees), the 13 raw .txt files were removed from `apps/os/src/content/context/raw-scripts/` and moved to the private vault. Their canonical-timeline anchors remain in [calendar-transcript-matches.js](../apps/os/src/content/context/calendar-transcript-matches.js) as `held: "private-vault"` sources carrying a `vault_id` join key and a snapshot of person/team mention hits, so person and team timelines keep full fidelity. Only public-safe files stay bundled: the two redacted excerpts and the distilled WDYDLW recap. Distilled insights (journal articles, recaps, event pages) are unaffected.
>
> **Insights pipeline.** Each vault transcript gets a public-safe distilled readout, hardcoded via `npm run ingest:readouts <readouts.json>` ([ingest-session-readouts.mjs](../scripts/ingest-session-readouts.mjs)): canonical structured readouts land in [session-insights.json](../cohort-data/session-insights.json) (shipped in the app surface as `session_insights`), per-team cues append to [constellation-cues.json](../cohort-data/constellation-cues.json) (rendered in constellation inspectors today), and human-readable review copies land in [session-readouts/](../cohort-data/session-readouts/). Sessions with external or featured speakers carry `consent: speaker-pending` and are held to thematic, unattributed distillation until a speaker consent pass.

## Confidence Scale

| confidence | meaning |
|---|---|
| high | Calendar date/title and transcript file clearly describe the same session. |
| medium | Date and topic line up, but the transcript spans a broader conversation, an adjacent block, or a segment inferred from surrounding context. |
| low | Do not link. The match is too weak for the app surface. |

## Bundled Public-Safe Files

The public repo now carries exactly **one** transcript-derived `.txt` — the distilled WDYDLW recap (reconstructed, not verbatim, and already backed by a consented public journal article). Everything else is published as **distilled readouts** in [session-insights.json](../cohort-data/session-insights.json) / [session-readouts/](../cohort-data/session-readouts/), with raw transcripts held in the private vault.

| file | calendar match | confidence | boundary decision |
|---|---|---:|---|
| [WDYDLW Standup Recap June 8 2026](<../apps/os/src/content/context/raw-scripts/WDYDLW Standup Recap June 8 2026.txt>) | `2026-06-08` WDYDLW with Shaw | high | Distilled reconstructed recap, not a verbatim transcript. Source capture stays private. |

> **2026-06-11 redaction-tier cleanup.** The two redacted excerpts (Teleport Router onboarding May 27, Agentic Tooling workshop May 28) previously lived here as near-verbatim `.txt` with `[redacted]` markers. Because an abridged/near-verbatim transcript is a gated-cohort-tier artifact (not a public one), they were distilled into paraphrased readouts (`teleport-router-onboarding-2026-05-27`, `agentic-tooling-workshop-2026-05-28`), their calendar anchors converted to `held: "private-vault"`, and the raw redacted `.txt` moved to the vault. The public repo no longer carries any verbatim or near-verbatim speaker dialogue.

## Calendar Coverage

Office-hours links are intentionally excluded. This table covers the substantive non-office-hours calendar blocks that have a timeline anchor in the OS. "held privately" means the raw text lives in the private vault and only the anchor + mention snapshot are committed, keyed by `vault_id`.

| date | calendar block | confidence | source |

## Distilled But Without A Calendar Anchor

These vault transcripts have **distilled readouts** in the OS but no matching calendar block (undated salons), so they carry no calendar-timeline anchor — they surface only via session insights and constellation cues.

| readout | note |
|---|---|
| `tee-dstack-easytee-phala` | TEE/dstack convergence salon, undated. Distilled; no calendar block to anchor to. |
| `dstack-hangout` | Informal dstack hangout, undated. Distilled; no calendar block to anchor to. |

## Excluded Entirely

| file | note |
|---|---|
| Office Hours Transcript | Office-hours material (private 1:1 / team feedback) is excluded from the OS by policy — no readout, no cues, no anchor. Held in the private vault only. |

## Missing Or Unresolved

These calendar blocks do not currently have a transcript source. They should not block the work above, but they are the remaining audit gaps if the goal is full week 1/2 calendar coverage.

| date | calendar block | OS status | next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `2026-05-19` | Founder night - Carter Cleveland | Event exists as [Carter Cleveland founder journey](../cohort-data/events/2026-05-19-carter-cleveland-founder-journey.md), but no transcript anchor is linked. | Add a held-private anchor only if a reviewed recording/transcript exists. |
| `2026-05-27` | Flashnet jam | No matched transcript file found. | Look for a reviewed jam transcript or leave unlinked. |
| `2026-05-29` | router onboarding/workshop | Prior review identified a likely Router/Hermes transcript, but the reviewed file is not in the vault inventory. | Anchor only if the reviewed transcript is recovered; do not substitute office-hours material. |

## Ignored For This Submission

These are intentionally out of scope: office-hours blobs, 1:1 material, private team PMF/GTM/fundraising feedback, private customer/company examples, private event-planning details, and sorting-hat dinner material. This is a confidence-high exclusion: they either do not map to the requested calendar workshop/lecture blocks or require explicit private-boundary approval before becoming OS context.

## Content Boundary Rules

1. **Raw transcripts never enter the public repo or the app bundle.** They live in the private vault. The public repo carries only the timeline anchor (`held: "private-vault"`, `vault_id`, mention snapshot) in `calendar-transcript-matches.js`.
2. Public-safe redacted excerpts and distilled recaps may be bundled when the session context is worth surfacing, following the May 27/28 redacted-excerpt pattern: preserve calendar/session context, strip private PMF, GTM, fundraising, positioning, customer/company, and team-specific product feedback.
3. Distilled insights for the cohort (readouts, abridged transcripts, Q&A) belong on a password-gated cohort surface, not in this repo. Public-facing distillations additionally require speaker/attendee consent.
4. When in doubt, hold the raw transcript and ship only the anchor.
