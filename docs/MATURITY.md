# Shape Rotator OS — Maturity Log

Hourly autonomous self-assessment + improvement loop. Each entry is appended; the audit trail is the file. Don't rewrite history.

## 2026-05-19 06:30 EDT

**Score**: 6/10 (early alpha — Phase 2 sync proven on LAN, heartbeat pulses + activity log live, LS cache yields instant boot on subsequent launches, but onboarding flow still rough and mac-x64 binary missing from latest swf-node releases)

**Picked**: nothing — queue full, holding for review

**Why**: 5 open PRs across both repos (threshold is >2 for the maturity tick). Per guardrail: "do nothing this tick except log 'queue full, holding'".

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Queue snapshot**:
- sros #76 (nikolaixyz): profile: update kristel-alliksaar (+14/-5) — external author, awaiting human review
- sros #93 (dmarzzz): feat(hermes) Ollama PoC (+480/-1) — large diff, awaiting human review
- swf-node #11, #10, #9 (dependabot): action version bumps

**Next tick should**: re-check the queue. If it's drained below 3 open PRs, identify the next improvement: most likely candidates are (a) onboarding flow for first-launch UX, (b) README install steps for cohort members, (c) investigate mac-x64 swf-node binary queue stuck on GH Actions, (d) spec drift between docs/SYNC.md §11 LAN-trust mode and current store.py behavior.

## 2026-05-19 07:25 EDT

**Score**: 6/10 (unchanged from 06:30 — no work shipped, queue still blocking)

**Picked**: nothing — queue full, holding for review

**Why**: same as previous tick. Same 5 PRs open (sros #76, #93; swf-node #9, #10, #11). Threshold is >2 for the maturity tick.

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Next tick should**: if queue STILL hasn't moved by the next firing, escalate visibly to the user — three consecutive blocked ticks means the loop is wasting its window. Highest-leverage candidates ready to ship the moment the queue clears: (a) onboarding flow polish, (b) README cohort install steps, (c) mac-x64 GH-Actions investigation, (d) docs/SYNC.md §11 spec audit.

## 2026-05-19 08:25 EDT

**Score**: 6/10 (unchanged — third consecutive maturity-tick hold, same 5 PRs open since 06:30)

**Picked**: nothing — queue full, holding for review

**Why**: guardrail says ">2 open PRs → do nothing except log". 5 > 2.

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Loop drift warning**: this is the third maturity tick blocked by the same queue. The loop is producing log-only entries with zero forward motion. The hourly cron will keep firing for 7 days; if no human triage happens, we'll have ~168 maturity entries that all say "held". Recommend either (a) triage #76 and #93 manually, or (b) raise the threshold guardrail from >2 to a value that lets dependabot-style trios drain alongside larger held PRs.

**Next tick should**: re-check. If still 5 PRs open, write a CRITICAL entry surfacing the loop-drift to the user.

## 2026-05-19 09:25 EDT — CRITICAL: LOOP-DRIFT

**Score**: 6/10 (unchanged — fourth consecutive maturity-tick hold)

**Picked**: nothing — queue full, holding for review

**Why**: 5 PRs open, threshold >2. Same configuration as the prior four ticks.

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Critical signal to user**: this loop has now held for FOUR consecutive ticks (06:30, 07:25, 08:25, 09:25 EDT) with zero forward progress. The cron is firing on schedule but the guardrail is filtering 100% of attempts. Three options:

1. **Human triage**: merge or close SROS #76 (nikolaixyz profile update) and #93 (Hermes Ollama PoC). Once the queue drops below 3 total, the next tick will resume shipping.
2. **Adjust guardrail**: raise the maturity-tick threshold from >2 to >5 so dependabot stacks don't block all forward motion. (Requires editing the cron prompt; out of this loop's scope.)
3. **Cancel the cron**: if the loop is no longer useful, run `CronDelete` on jobs 457ab077 (maturity) and 36ad8775 (PR triage). Both jobs will otherwise auto-expire in ~7 days.

This entry is the explicit drift escalation flagged by the 08:25 tick. No further drift entries until human action.

**Next tick should**: if queue is unchanged, log the hold tersely without re-escalating (no point in repeating this critical entry every hour).

## 2026-05-19 15:25 EDT

**Score**: 6.5/10 (queue churned during the last tick: previous-batch #76 + dependabot trio #9/#10/#11 merged via human triage. Two new agent-shipped PRs opened this hour — SROS #97 (Network tab unified /node/log refactor, ~771 LOC) and swf-node #17 (/node/log endpoint + node-wide event ring, v0.12.0 target). New PR #94 (cohort membership taxonomy + broadsheet calendar) also landed from outside this loop.)

**Picked**: nothing — queue at 4 PRs (sros #93, #94, #97; swf-node #17). Threshold is >2.

**Why**: guardrail says hold.

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick directly. Two large PRs (#97 + #17) were shipped via parallel agents earlier this hour in a chat-driven push and are awaiting human review.

**Next tick should**: assume swf-node #17 (touches sync wire protocol + new endpoint) needs human approval before the PR-triage tick can merge it. Once merged + tagged as v0.12.0 + binaries built, SROS #97 becomes eligible (currently degrades to /sync/log fallback, but the full experience needs #17 shipped first).

## 2026-05-19 16:25 EDT

**Score**: 7/10 (early beta — queue cleared, Network tab now shows live unified node events post-v0.1.32, peer_unreachable spam fixed in v0.12.1, CSS overlap fixed in v0.1.33. Three real peers on user's LAN being discovered + tracked. The visible-activity story is real now.)

**Picked**: cohort-onboarding section in docs/INSTALL.md — explains mDNS discovery, LAN-trust, Network tab live events, and the two edit paths (sync vs GitHub PR fallback).

**Why**: INSTALL.md had zero mention of Phase 2 sync after 12h of shipping it. A cohort member installing on day 1 (the literal mission target) had no story for "what should I see on the Network tab" or "how does my profile edit reach my neighbors". This is pure spec-↔-code drift cleanup, in service of the "cohort member installs without you helping them" optimization target.

**Shipped**:
- (in flight) docs(install): cohort-onboarding section — peer discovery, LAN-trust, Network tab expectations, sync-vs-PR fallback

**Next tick should**: if v0.1.33 dmg is fully landed + user confirms the peer_unreachable spam + CSS overlap are gone, score nudges to 7.5. Next bottleneck is likely either (a) Atlas tab still shows blank for users with no indexed pages — needs a friendlier empty state, (b) mac-x64 GH Actions queue still stuck — Intel-mac cohort members get stub binaries, (c) the actual cross-machine sync test the user is supposed to verify but hasn't yet.

## 2026-05-19 17:25 EDT

7/10, held. 3 open PRs (sros #93/#94/#98). #98 "skip splash on warm boot" is high-leverage but trapped behind oldest-first in the PR-triage loop. Recommend user fast-merges it.

## 2026-05-19 18:25 EDT

7/10, held. Queue back up to 5 (#93/#94/#98/#99/#100). Three of the new arrivals (#98/#99/#100) are exactly the small UX-polish PRs that would each nudge the score; all stuck behind #93 (broken-flagged) + #94 (size-flagged).
