# Shape Rotator OS — Maturity Log

Hourly autonomous self-assessment + improvement loop. Each entry is appended; the audit trail is the file. Don't rewrite history.

## 2026-05-19 06:30 EDT

**Score**: 6/10 (early alpha — Phase 2 sync proven on LAN, heartbeat pulses + activity log live, LS cache yields instant boot on subsequent launches, but onboarding flow still rough and mac-x64 binary missing from latest swf-node releases)

**Picked**: nothing — queue full, holding for review

**Why**: 5 open PRs across both repos (threshold is >2 for the maturity tick). Per guardrail: "do nothing this tick except log 'queue full, holding'".

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Queue snapshot**:
- sros #76 (nikolaixyz): profile: update kristel-alliksaar (+14/-5) — external author, awaiting human review
- sros #93 (dmarzzz): feat(hermes) Ollama PoC (+480/-1) — large diff, awaiting human review
- swf-node #11, #10, #9 (dependabot): action version bumps

**Next tick should**: re-check the queue. If it's drained below 3 open PRs, identify the next improvement: most likely candidates are (a) onboarding flow for first-launch UX, (b) README install steps for cohort members, (c) investigate mac-x64 swf-node binary queue stuck on GH Actions, (d) spec drift between docs/SYNC.md §11 LAN-trust mode and current store.py behavior.

## 2026-05-19 07:25 EDT

**Score**: 6/10 (unchanged from 06:30 — no work shipped, queue still blocking)

**Picked**: nothing — queue full, holding for review

**Why**: same as previous tick. Same 5 PRs open (sros #76, #93; swf-node #9, #10, #11). Threshold is >2 for the maturity tick.

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Next tick should**: if queue STILL hasn't moved by the next firing, escalate visibly to the user — three consecutive blocked ticks means the loop is wasting its window. Highest-leverage candidates ready to ship the moment the queue clears: (a) onboarding flow polish, (b) README cohort install steps, (c) mac-x64 GH-Actions investigation, (d) docs/SYNC.md §11 spec audit.

## 2026-05-19 08:25 EDT

**Score**: 6/10 (unchanged — third consecutive maturity-tick hold, same 5 PRs open since 06:30)

**Picked**: nothing — queue full, holding for review

**Why**: guardrail says ">2 open PRs → do nothing except log". 5 > 2.

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Loop drift warning**: this is the third maturity tick blocked by the same queue. The loop is producing log-only entries with zero forward motion. The hourly cron will keep firing for 7 days; if no human triage happens, we'll have ~168 maturity entries that all say "held". Recommend either (a) triage #76 and #93 manually, or (b) raise the threshold guardrail from >2 to a value that lets dependabot-style trios drain alongside larger held PRs.

**Next tick should**: re-check. If still 5 PRs open, write a CRITICAL entry surfacing the loop-drift to the user.

## 2026-05-19 09:25 EDT — CRITICAL: LOOP-DRIFT

**Score**: 6/10 (unchanged — fourth consecutive maturity-tick hold)

**Picked**: nothing — queue full, holding for review

**Why**: 5 PRs open, threshold >2. Same configuration as the prior four ticks.

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Critical signal to user**: this loop has now held for FOUR consecutive ticks (06:30, 07:25, 08:25, 09:25 EDT) with zero forward progress. The cron is firing on schedule but the guardrail is filtering 100% of attempts. Three options:

1. **Human triage**: merge or close SROS #76 (nikolaixyz profile update) and #93 (Hermes Ollama PoC). Once the queue drops below 3 total, the next tick will resume shipping.
2. **Adjust guardrail**: raise the maturity-tick threshold from >2 to >5 so dependabot stacks don't block all forward motion. (Requires editing the cron prompt; out of this loop's scope.)
3. **Cancel the cron**: if the loop is no longer useful, run `CronDelete` on jobs 457ab077 (maturity) and 36ad8775 (PR triage). Both jobs will otherwise auto-expire in ~7 days.

This entry is the explicit drift escalation flagged by the 08:25 tick. No further drift entries until human action.

**Next tick should**: if queue is unchanged, log the hold tersely without re-escalating (no point in repeating this critical entry every hour).

## 2026-05-19 10:25 EDT

## 2026-05-19 15:25 EDT

**Score**: 6.5/10 (queue churned during the last tick: previous-batch #76 + dependabot trio #9/#10/#11 merged via human triage. Two new agent-shipped PRs opened this hour — SROS #97 (Network tab unified /node/log refactor, ~771 LOC) and swf-node #17 (/node/log endpoint + node-wide event ring, v0.12.0 target). New PR #94 (cohort membership taxonomy + broadsheet calendar) also landed from outside this loop.)

**Picked**: nothing — queue at 4 PRs (sros #93, #94, #97; swf-node #17). Threshold is >2.

**Why**: guardrail says hold.

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick directly. Two large PRs (#97 + #17) were shipped via parallel agents earlier this hour in a chat-driven push and are awaiting human review.

**Next tick should**: assume swf-node #17 (touches sync wire protocol + new endpoint) needs human approval before the PR-triage tick can merge it. Once merged + tagged as v0.12.0 + binaries built, SROS #97 becomes eligible (currently degrades to /sync/log fallback, but the full experience needs #17 shipped first).

## 2026-05-19 16:25 EDT

**Score**: 7/10 (early beta — queue cleared, Network tab now shows live unified node events post-v0.1.32, peer_unreachable spam fixed in v0.12.1, CSS overlap fixed in v0.1.33. Three real peers on user's LAN being discovered + tracked. The visible-activity story is real now.)

**Picked**: cohort-onboarding section in docs/INSTALL.md — explains mDNS discovery, LAN-trust, Network tab live events, and the two edit paths (sync vs GitHub PR fallback).

**Why**: INSTALL.md had zero mention of Phase 2 sync after 12h of shipping it. A cohort member installing on day 1 (the literal mission target) had no story for "what should I see on the Network tab" or "how does my profile edit reach my neighbors". This is pure spec-↔-code drift cleanup, in service of the "cohort member installs without you helping them" optimization target.

**Shipped**:
- (in flight) docs(install): cohort-onboarding section — peer discovery, LAN-trust, Network tab expectations, sync-vs-PR fallback

**Next tick should**: if v0.1.33 dmg is fully landed + user confirms the peer_unreachable spam + CSS overlap are gone, score nudges to 7.5. Next bottleneck is likely either (a) Atlas tab still shows blank for users with no indexed pages — needs a friendlier empty state, (b) mac-x64 GH Actions queue still stuck — Intel-mac cohort members get stub binaries, (c) the actual cross-machine sync test the user is supposed to verify but hasn't yet.

## 2026-05-19 17:25 EDT

7/10, held. 3 open PRs (sros #93/#94/#98). #98 "skip splash on warm boot" is high-leverage but trapped behind oldest-first in the PR-triage loop. Recommend user fast-merges it.

## 2026-05-19 18:25 EDT

7/10, held. Queue back up to 5 (#93/#94/#98/#99/#100). Three of the new arrivals (#98/#99/#100) are exactly the small UX-polish PRs that would each nudge the score; all stuck behind #93 (broken-flagged) + #94 (size-flagged).

## 2026-05-19 20:25 EDT

**Score**: 7.5/10 (steady — calendar fix shipped v0.1.35 earlier this hour, queue drained, v0.1.34's Hermes window verified to have proper "ollama not running" empty state.)

**Picked**: swf-node v0.12.2 — fix `scraper_pulled` payload field collision (`kind` was reserved, silently dropped; renderer reads `kind_pulled`).

**Why**: small spec/code drift bug that made every scraper_pulled row in the Network tab read "scraper · N records" instead of "scraper · N pages". Single-line code fix + spec table update.

**Shipped**:
- swf-node `0ee1bac` + tag `v0.12.2` — `fix(events): scraper_pulled emits kind_pulled (was silently dropped)`

**Next tick should**: once v0.12.2 binaries land, the next SROS release will bundle the corrected daemon. Otherwise the next highest-leverage candidate is probably auditing whether the renderer's `web_search_completed` row consumes the right field names too (similar potential drift), or looking at first-launch onboarding modal polish.

## 2026-05-19 21:25 EDT

**Score**: 7.5/10 (audit on web_search_completed + bundle_pulled + mdns_peer_appeared shows no drift — only scraper_pulled had the issue. Picked the next-highest-leverage move from prior tick's checklist instead.)

**Picked**: SROS v0.1.36 — onboarding modal subscribes to cohort changes so dropdowns repopulate when fresh data lands.

**Why**: on cold first launch the LS cache / fixture is sparse before the GH tree fetch resolves; users opening the app fresh saw half-empty dropdowns, dismissed, never claimed. ~20 LOC, single file, isolated bug fix.

**Shipped**:
- SROS `e848c77` + tag `v0.1.36` — `fix(onboarding): repopulate dropdowns when cohort refreshes`

**Next tick should**: dmg build for v0.1.36 lands ~5min. Otherwise the loop's worth chasing: the v0.12.0/v0.12.1/v0.12.2 swf-node release-binaries CI runs are STILL queued for ~5h+ on macos-13 (mac-x64). Investigation of GH Actions queue OR matrix fallback to a cross-compile path would be the next big-leverage move.

## 2026-05-19 22:25 EDT

**Score**: 7.5/10 (steady — calendar polish stack continues to stack via #103/#104/#105 on `review/calendar-ux-stack`, v0.1.36 onboarding fix shipped, swf-node v0.12.2 queue-stuck on mac-x64 like everything else.)

**Picked**: swf-node CI hygiene — 35-min per-leg timeout in release-binaries so mac-x64 doesn't anchor the workflow status indefinitely.

**Why**: cleanest concrete move from the prior tick's checklist. Doesn't fully fix the chronic macos-13 free-tier queue but caps the running portion so workflow status converges. Single-file CI change.

**Shipped**:
- swf-node `b326bfa` — `ci(release): bound mac-x64 wall time so the workflow can complete`

**Next tick should**: the real fix for mac-x64 is either (a) explicit cancel via a scheduled workflow that runs `gh run cancel` on legs queued >30min, (b) drop mac-x64 from auto-tag matrix and trigger only via workflow_dispatch, or (c) cross-compile from macos-14 arm64. None of these are 1-tick changes. Consider for a future planning tick.

## 2026-05-19 23:25 EDT

**Score**: 8/10 (first time pushing past 7.5 — empty-state coverage is now reasonable across all main panels. Atlas was the last big gap.)

**Picked**: SROS v0.1.37 — Atlas tab "indrex empty" panel for the fresh-install case (daemon up, no pages indexed yet).

**Why**: a cohort member on day 1 of the program sees the daemon up but no pages yet (their first search would index one). Before this, Atlas was a black 3D void with the "composing graph…" status stuck — feels broken. Now it shows a friendly "no pages yet" panel that auto-clears once the reconcile poll spots a first node. 3 files, ~40 LOC, well within guardrails.

**Shipped**:
- SROS `b972035` + tag `v0.1.37` — `feat(atlas): friendly empty state when indrex has 0 indexed pages`

**Next tick should**: install + verify the panel renders on a fresh /graph response with 0 nodes. Otherwise the next-highest-leverage candidate is probably the Network tab having a similar empty case (no peers discovered yet — though we usually do see self), or a similar panel for the Constellation tab if it has a parallel "no data" black-scene problem.

## 2026-05-20 00:25 EDT

**Score**: 8/10 (steady, no work this tick)

**Picked**: nothing — no high-value 1-tick improvement identified

**Why**: Constellation tab renders from cohort-data/teams which always has content (no empty case to fix). Audited peer_reachable / peer_unreachable / pulled / applied_local payload consumption against renderer — daemon doesn't emit `peer_name` on health events, but the renderer falls back to nick-from-srwk.peers which works for any indrex-known peer. Not a hard bug, just a marginal robustness improvement that's not 1-tick. Real next-level moves (multi-pubkey-per-handle, cross-machine sync verification, mac-x64 CI fix) all require multiple ticks of focused work.

**Shipped**:
- nothing this tick

**Next tick should**: hold or pick: (a) emit peer_name in sync_loop's peer_reachable/peer_unreachable events for nicer rendering of just-appeared/just-disappeared peers, (b) write a CHANGELOG.md aggregating the 30+ patches shipped today so a cohort onboarding link can point at "what changed", or (c) audit one more spec section for drift.

## 2026-05-20 10:17 EDT

8/10, no work. Same #106 unchanged overnight, no new PRs. Maturity tick + PR triage tick fired simultaneously this hour — both held / no-op.

## 2026-05-19 19:25 EDT

**Score**: 7.5/10 (queue fully drained this hour via user-authorized chat-driven merges. #93 Hermes PoC, #94 cohort taxonomy + calendar overhaul, #98 warm-boot splash-skip all merged. #99/#100/#101 closed by user. SROS v0.1.34 tagged.)

**Picked**: `docs/SYNC.md` §12 peer_unreachable spec audit — aligns the table + footnote with the v0.12.1 transitions-only semantics that shipped earlier this hour.

**Why**: spec-vs-code drift on a wire-protocol observability event. The table was promising "emit per failed fetch" but the code now emits only on state change. Drift here makes the activity log harder to reason about for future contributors.

**Shipped**:
- swf-node `0ad701a` — `docs(sync): update §12 peer_unreachable semantics to match v0.12.1`

**Next tick should**: verify v0.1.34 dmg lands + Hermes window opens without Ollama running (the user previously flagged this as broken — needs to either render an empty/error state or open without crashing). If broken, fix the Hermes empty state. If fine, next biggest drift candidate is `docs/SYNC.md` §13 description vs. actual /node/log payload shapes — quick audit.
